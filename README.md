# mimxrt1062
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to MIMXRT1062 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support.

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

## Usage

To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.mimxrt1062]
version = "0.1.0"
features = ["rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
use mimxrt1062;

let mut peripherals = mimxrt1062::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```
